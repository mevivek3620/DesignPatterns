package DesignPattern.Factory;

//    Q. When to use the Factory method pattern?
//        There should be a set of classes which implement a common interface
//        You donâ€™t know which object to create ( You know which object to create only at run time)
//        Object initialization is somewhat expensive(Have to do some operations in order to create an object)
